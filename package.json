  "description": "Players will be given 5 images of yoga poses and their respective names. Players will have to memorize those poses with their names and will be given 30 seconds to do so. Players will then be given a yoga pose name and they will have to re-enact the position. They will get points if they get the pose correct and earn points, if not then they lose a life. Once the player loses all his lives then the game ends and saves the player's score.",
